# basic-ml-classification-decision-tree

## Project Description

This repository contains a project focused on using **decision trees** for business analysis and modeling. The primary goal is to develop a deep understanding of decision trees and their statistical foundations while testing the limits of this simpler algorithm without relying on more advanced machine learning models.

Although there are more sophisticated packages and techniques available, this project is intentionally focused on **decision trees** to emphasize interpretability and explore the trade-offs of using this method.

## Key Objectives

- **Understand decision trees**: Explore how decision trees make splits and select variables.
- **Test the limits**: Push the decision tree model to its boundaries to understand its strengths and limitations.
- **Business interpretation**: Derive actionable business insights from the decision tree results.

## Repository Structure

- **`notebooks/`**: Contains Jupyter notebooks with the full analysis, model training, and evaluation.
- **`data/`**: Placeholder directory for datasets used in the project.
- **`README.md`**: This file, providing an overview of the project and instructions for use.
